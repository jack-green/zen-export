            Hey guys,
        </p>
        <p>
            With the move away from Zen Planner to Wodify, I thought i'd throw together a little 
            tool to help make the transition easier.
        </p>
        <p>
            Simply enter your Zen Planner login email &amp; password on the left and hit the 
            'Fetch My Results' button to get a nice list of all the WOD / 1RM results you've put 
            into Zen Planner.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>I double-decker pinky promise that i'm not doing anything dodgy with your Zen Planner 
            password, but feel free to change it before / after doing this or talk to me 
            if you're suspicious.</em>
        </p>

            Cheers, Jack
